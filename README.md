## Abstract
In an era where mobile and technological innovation continues to reshape daily life, ARecipe emerges as a solution to address two significant challenges that college students are facing in the realm of food consumption: accessibility & education to diverse recipes and the reduction of food waste due to leaving in the fridge for too long. Leveraging the power of camera technology, machine learning algorithms, and augmented reality, ARecipe empowers users to effortlessly discover recipes tailored to the ingredients available in their fridge, and real-time recipe instructions while cooking. By seamlessly integrating with both mobile and web platforms, this innovative app revolutionizes the culinary experience by not only suggesting recipes based on existing ingredients but also keeping track of favourite learned recipes. ARecipe's mission lies at the intersection of education, convenience and sustainability, making cooking more interactive. Offering users a practical tool to navigate their culinary endeavours while championing responsible consumption practices. “Anyone can cook!”
