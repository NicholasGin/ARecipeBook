# Basic Commands:
git init                           # Initialize a new Git repository
git clone <repository_url>         # Clone a repository
git status                         # Check the status of your working directory
git add <file(s)>                  # Add changes to the staging area
git commit -m "Commit message"     # Commit changes
git push origin <branch_name>      # Push changes to a remote repository
git pull origin <branch_name>      # Pull changes from a remote repository
git fetch                          # Fetch changes from a remote repository

# Branching and Merging:
git branch <branch_name>           # Create a new branch
git checkout <branch_name>         # Switch to a branch
git switch <branch_name>           # Switch to a branch (alternative)
git checkout -b <new_branch_name>  # Create and switch to a new branch
git switch -c <new_branch_name>    # Create and switch to a new branch (alternative)
git merge <branch_name>            # Merge a branch into the current branch
git branch -d <branch_name>        # Delete a local branch

# Remote Branch Operations:
git push origin <local_branch_name>:<remote_branch_name>  # Push a local branch to a remote repository
git push origin --delete <remote_branch_name>            # Delete a remote branch
git fetch --all                    # Fetch remote branches
git branch -u origin/<remote_branch_name>                # Track a remote branch
