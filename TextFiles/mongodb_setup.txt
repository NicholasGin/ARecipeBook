Setting Up MongoDB for the Project

To run the project locally, you need to have MongoDB installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up MongoDB:

Step 1: Install MongoDB

1. Download the MongoDB Community Server from the official website: [MongoDB Download](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Step 2: Start MongoDB

On Unix-like Systems (Linux, macOS):

Open a terminal and run the following command:

mongod

On Windows:

1. Open the Command Prompt as an administrator.
2. Navigate to the MongoDB installation directory.
3. Run the following command:

mongod.exe

Leave this terminal or command prompt window open to keep the MongoDB server running.

Step 3: Configure Connection URL

1. In the project's root directory, find the .env file.
2. Ensure that the MongoDB connection URL in the .env file is set correctly. It should look like:

MONGODB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/user_auth

Step 4: Run the Application

Now that MongoDB is set up, you can run the project:

1. Open a new terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Run the command to start the application (e.g., npm start or ng serve).

The application should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

Note: Keep the MongoDB server running in the background while working on the project.
